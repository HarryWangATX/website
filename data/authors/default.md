Welcome to my blog! I'm Qi Wang (Harry), a student at Westlake High School. I am an enthusiastic 
computer scientist interested in algorithms and artificial intelligence. I love conducting 
interdisciplinary research as well as computer science related investigations. Outside of this,
I am one of the top high school clarinetist in Texas and enjoy participating in my school's marching as 
 well as concert band.


I also have a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMWyG1D_a_b2HRLlBPkGMw) that 
talks about algorithms as well as many other programming aspects. Make sure to subscribe for 
more information. Other than that, if you have any questions, make sure to shoot me an email at 
**randomCoder12@gmail.com** and I'll try my best to respond as soon as possible. Enjoy my blog!
