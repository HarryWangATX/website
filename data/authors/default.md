Welcome to my blog! I'm Qi Wang (Harry), a student at Westlake High School. In my spare time, I like to code, read, and play music. I also swim outside of school. I have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMWyG1D_a_b2HRLlBPkGMw) that talks about algorithms as well as many other programming aspects. Make sure to subscribe for more information. Other than that, if you have any questions, make sure to shoot me an email at **randomCoder12@gmail.com** and I'll try my best to respond as soon as possible. Enjoy my blog!
